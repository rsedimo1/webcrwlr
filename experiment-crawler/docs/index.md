Ideally, we would be able to use Google's massive index to find these resources. 

# Sources for experiments

Who is doing experiments?

Starting points.

A/B testing
- ecommerce

# Types of experimental manipulation

## Homegrown

### Non-random assignment

* Use of modulus operator
* Finding high cardinalty units

## Random assignment
* Math.random, identify other libraries for random assignment

## All
* Use of [meaningful variable names](../semvarnames.txt)

take a snapshot of the webpage
track whether and how the the page changes
need to have a database running somewhere
